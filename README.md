# tams-signature-demo

This is a simple signature project responsible for handling authentication in tams-api calls. It provides only the basic si[generate_signature.py](..%2F..%2F..%2F..%2Fpython%2Ftest%2Fgenerate_signature.py)gnature functionality and does not handle the SDK encapsulation for the API.
Note that all code suggestions are recommended for development purposes only. In a production environment, it is advisable to use a more secure method to store your private key to prevent any loss or leakage.
